For the record:

This is a list of songs stolen from me in Nashville.
I'm only including the first verse and the hook


(Sober) mid tempo

Prehook 
I don’t wanna come on strong
I wanna come home sober
Let the good times roll on
For me the party over
Enough is enough is enough
Of this rolling in clover
I just wanna get back to us
And my life with my one girl
1st verse
Mama said I was too young
Daddy said son first see the world
Everybody said have fun
Before you settle with one girl
I don’t wanna listen to none
Of that talk cuz I loved you
Seven years later that talk
Is all the talk that I listen to
I feel I missed out on so much
And girl you know the devil will
Sure enough hook you up
With the way when you got the will

(One guy you’re missing) slow
1st verse
I see stormy in your eyes
And it’s a beautiful night
It must belong to you
But you left it outside
I see lonely in your smile
And I’m wondering why
There’s not a million men marching
To be here by your side
Hook or chorus
There must be one guy you’re missing
The only one you’re kissing
And he’s got you all dressed up
With nowhere to go
There must be one guy you love
The only one you want
And he’s got you all dress up
And all alone

(You know)uptempo
Ist verse
Girl when you go to bed tonite
Baby think of me alright?
And if you count sheep to fall asleep
Make one of ‘em look like me
Make him cute and cuddlely though
With a Thomas eyes and nose
And a Thomas lips and a Thomas arms and a Thomas
Well
You know
Hook
Make him sheep number 23
Then put him on repeat
Make him come back around again and again
Until he puts you to sleep
With his a Thomas lips and his a Thomas arms and a Thomas
You know

(Custom fit)midtempo
1st verse
Like that custom fit
That tailor made suit
Created just for me
Like that vision in the night
Shining in my eyes
That no one else can see
When they look at you baby
They see a girl
When I look at your face
I see the light of the world
They look at you smiling
Like you aint heaven sent
I look at you smile
And it’s an epic event
Hook
Like a tornado wind
A hurricane rain
Thunder on a mountain
Volcano shooting flame
To me you oughta be in
Heaven on a throne
Cuz you’re not just a woman
You’re a phenomenon

(the church is this way)midtempo
1st verse
Baby I am a  man
Of my word
And I will stand
By everything say
I told you I got plans
For you and me girl
And all you gotta do
Is take my hand and walk this way
They always talking behind my back
Saying what I will and won’t do
I’m gonna show you right now
Who’s telling you the truth
Hook
Girl the church is this way
And the bullsh—is that way
where the bull is at
Let’s start walking baby
I’m gonna show you
where the pull is at
Let them pull out that bull
I’ma pull out this ring
They say I don’t
I’ll say I do
I will marry you right now
I’m in love with you.

(wish I had that girl)slow verses, midtempo hook
1st verse
I wish I had that girl
Sitting at that table
If I had that girl
I could take on the whole wide world
Bend it to my will…
And I wouldn’t be here
She’s the kind of girl
 Make a man wanna make her
The center of his world
Bend it to her will
And I wouldn’t be here
Pre-Hook
I would be at home
This time around the house
Planting in her garden
Kissing on her mouth
Talking on the phone
To her mom and dad
Taking Lamaze classes
For the baby that we’ll have
Hook
You might not think I’m a strong man
But you can bring it on man
Talk that liquor courage
But I talk with some stone hands
The way I’ll treat that woman
Aint the way I’d box your ear…
Except I wouldn’t be here

(put you to work) fast comedy

Prehook
1st verse
Hold up
Gotta put you to work
You can’t walk around here
Looking that damn good
Without nothing to do
In that old t-shirt
I’m the sheriff baby and you got too many people hurt
I say now hold up
Gotta put you to work
There was an accident down on main and third
Old billy bob jones got a hitch in his shirt
He had a heart attack now we gotta put him in the dirt

**************************************

( don’t let the girl get away) slow
1st verse
If it was over
She wouldn’t be so hurt
No matter what she’s saying now
Don’t just let go of her
If it was too late
She wouldn’t have waited
To give you the chance to say a word
Now you gotta take it
Hook
Don’t let the girl
Get away
Don’t let your doubts break your heart
And make your mouth too slow to say
Baby I’m sorry
Baby don’t leave me
Honey I love you
Please forgive me

**************************************


(Let her go)uptempo
1st verse
You hold on too much
When you hold on too tight
You aint supposed to have it
If your head aint on right
You wanna do her shopping
But you don’t wanna do her right
You can’t lock that woman down like you do a bike
Hook
Let her go
Let her go let her go
Let her go
Let her go let her go
Let her go
Let her go let her go
Turn her loose man she don’t need to be with you no more
Let her go
Let her go let her go
Let her go
Let her go let her go
Let her go
Let her go let her go
Turn her loose don’t you know it’s after 1864

(without you) midtempo
1st verse
Without you
Life is a story without a plot
No line or meaning to it
No rhyme or reason to do it
Nothing to see here If you don’t be here
And nothing to try
Without you
Life is a song tossed in a pot
No time or meter to it
No rhythm or beat to move to
Just a whole lot of noise with a whole lot of toys
That money can buy
Hook
But with you
Everything’s beautiful
Everything’s doable
Why
Girl with you
Anything’s possible
Everything’s a plausible try
I’d run a million miles
Just to see a smile on your face
I’d climb a mountain high
Just to showoff because
You were looking my way

**************************************

(Let’s get funky)uptempo
prehook
Let’s get funky
Until the hour is up
Let’s get as busy as a bee baby 
In a flower shop
Let’s get funky
Until the hour is up
Let’s get as busy as a bee mama
In a flower shop
1st verse
You say you wanna be the flavor of the week
How ‘bout the flavor of the creep
How ‘bout two scoops in a coup
And a freak in a jeep

**************************************

(Did you get the gspot)uptempo
Prehook
Did you get the gspot
Was I johnny on the spot
Did I hit it or not
Cuz she looked so hot
Did you get the gspot
Was I johnny on the spot
Did I hit it or not
Cuz she looked so hot
Did you get the gspot
Was I johnny on the spot
Did I hit it or not
Cuz she looked so hot
1st verse
I was there
In a red hot minute
When my woman called
And said gi-gi-gi-gi-git it
I was right on time
Cuz she was right on the edge
I jumped right in and shook that bed

**************************************

(Daddys never)
 
She said I had it the way I wanted
I was on the outside because I wanted to be
I never tried too hard or too much at all
I see my daughters with their daughters
I don’t see a single barbie with a ken
I don’t see no me in their world
She said they never take the kens out of the box  [spoken]
They say daddys never want to play with little girls
 
2nd verse
 
Nine and eleven years ago
I was twenty-one and twenty-four
I remember two birthdays two miracles and things
But I don’t recall that I ever pushed a swing
 
I try to remember trips to the park
Birthday parties and laughing little girls
Playing house with all their brand new favorite presents
I cant remember a single time or event
Not even back then when I was ken
 
I took the dolls out of the boxes
One in each hand
I said can daddy play
They said no
Daddy that won’t work
Daddys never want to talk to little girls
 
And then they ran out of the room
This was nothing new but for the very first time
Instead of walking the other way feeling hurt
I followed them and I talked to my little girls
