Tailor written for you Zendee . 

Listed is the 1st verse and the hook of twelve songs for a Pop album.

I got more to choose from if you don't like them all, or if some are to risque for you.

I’ll send you the demo when I can get it done


first song

 (Mommy daddy)
 
[This part is spoken /rapped]  

Only cold water runs through the faucet at night.

Bathroom floor is as cold as ice.

Tried to get the landlord to fix that pipe.

But he only comes around when his money aint right.

Neighbor to the left all they do is cuss.

Neighbors up top all they do is f---.


[hook]

[this part is sung]

OH mommy...daddy.

Your baby girl wants to come back home.

Can your little girl come back home.

mommy... daddy.

Your baby girl wants to come back home.

[this line sung in a baby voice.]

Can your widdle  girl come back home

Song two

(scare her)

I swam up the river.

And  everybody screamed.

Itz easier to go down stream.

I swam up the river.

And somebody cried.

Stop her right now.

Shez waking up from the dream.


Hook [sung along with choir]


One monkey can stop a show.

We can not let her go.

Nobody can be allowed.

To think outside of the crowd.

Scare her scare her.

Let her know what happens.

To little thoughts who stray from the herd.

Scare her scare her.

Scare her back to napping.

Let out the predators.

C2020Tccmardukson

**************************************************


Third song

(rebel)

Rebel.

Even now I tremble at the thought of the way you touched me.

Rebel.

Where are you now remember what you promised for the way that you left me.

You said you’d be back to finish what you started.

Til you come back I’m living empty hearted.

You had to run so I had to let go.

Before you were done. 

But I can’t forget your.

Rebel.

Kiss on my lips in the shadow of the man who.

Swore for.

All that he live he’d kill you if he got the chance to.


C2020Tccmardukson

********************************


Fourth song

(love don’t wait)

I wanted a pair.

You only wanted hitz.

It wasn’t there.

Don’t try to bring love into this.

Now.

I wanna go.

You wanna hold on.

I loved you so.

You only showed you loved me from.

Now.

[hook]

Love don’t wait.

It only takes too late.

Sometimes.

Itz too late.

You can’t bring love into this.

Now.

Song 5

( I think I’m too good)

How many times am I gonna have to tell you no

How many times are you gonna have to tell me though

How I think I’m too good for you

Think I’m too cute for you

You are the dummy who

Keeps on saying it dude

[spoken] then again the truth is the truth]

Hook

I think I’m too bad

I think I’m too cool 

I think I too fine

I think I’m too much

I can’t f--- with you

I think I’m all that

I think I’m too smooth

I think I’m too nice

I’m think I’m too pretty

I can’t talk to you

C2020Tccmardukson

********************************************

Sixth song

(I don’t get you)

You say that you love me

But you won’t take my hand

Not even when we’re walking

Or even when we dance

You say that you need me

But you won’t take my hand

You gave me a ring

But you never even slipped it on

[Pre chorus]

You talk like I’m the only thing

In the world to you

You write like you’re so crazy in love

And you keep me so confused

[Chorus or hook]

I get calls

I get texts sent

I get packages

And I get messages

But i-i-i

Don’t get you

C2020Tccmardukson

******************************************************

Song seven

(mastu---)

He lean in 

And kiss me

And touch me

Below

I lean in 

And kiss him

The next thing

I know

We stumble to

The bedroom

And turn on the lights

I’m lying

Beside him

And it feels so nice

As we keep kissing his hand mastu---

C2020Tccmardukson

******************************************************

Song eight

(Soulless)

I got so much

And so less

I’m so much in love

I’m getting soulless

It’s a thin line between love and hate

And every time you make my heart break

I got so much

And so less

I’m so hurt in love

I’m getting soulless

C2020Tccmardukson

********************************************************

Song nine

(you can do that)

All the times I had you

All the times I laughed with you

Cried with you

Tried with you

Woke up with you

Broke up with you

cooked for you

dressed for you

tried to do

all the best I could do

to be around for you

I clowned for you

I laid my body down for you

[hook]

And you can do that

You can do that to me

You can do that

You can do that to me

Couldn’t you have given me at least

Enough respect to not to do that on my sheets

C2020Tccmardukson

****************************************************

Song ten

(some like that)

[Hook]

Some like that Some like that going away

I love you but I don’t want you to stay

Just a little bit of you can be a little too much

I want you  but I can’t take you for long

1st verse

Only when I miss you

Do I wanna kiss you

Only when I need you

Do I wanna see you

You make me so happy

When you’re coming back

But when you stay you make me sad

A good two or three days and you make me mad

C2020Tccmardukson

*************************************************************

Song eleven

(double down)

Double down

On the way that you’re kissing me

I’m ready 

in the place that you wanna be

keep pushing

on your way into ecstasy

don’t worry

I have taken care of everything

Double down

On the things that we usually do

Don’t  stop

In the way that we usually do

Keep going

It’s today that I want you to

Double down

Double down

Double down

Double down

Tonight is the night

I want you to make me your woman

Tonight is the night

I wanna be one on one

With the one I love.

C2020Tccmardukson


*******************************************************

Song twelve

(trouble man)

You’re a trouble man

You got a double strand

Of cockiness when you were born

You got up and ran

To make your mama cry

You haven’t slowed down since

And I don’t know why

I let you keep me in suspense

You’re always in a fight

With someone all over me

And you think its all right

Because like some Ali

You think you got the greatest

Hands alive

Although I really hate it

Couldn’t leave you if I tried
